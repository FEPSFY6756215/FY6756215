      Silicon based cells make up almost all solar cells in use and in production worldwide and
      have nearly reached their maximum theoretical levels of efficiency (Ehrler et al., 2020). This means that no
      large-scale gains can be made in the efficiency of this technology without an additional
      material being introduced, however, the introduction of additional materials may serve to
      increase cost. Therefore, the material added must be cheap, abundant, and the manufacturing
      processes used must be easily scalable, and the cells made must have no serious disadvantages
      compared to traditional cells (Peplow, 2023). Perovskite materials can be made using cheap and abundant
      elements (Attfield, Lightfoot, and Morris, 2015), but cells using only perovskite display poor longevity (Jean et al., 2019). 
      Perovskite-silicon tandem cells provide greater efficiency than either single option, and may have lifespans 
      on-par with silicon cells, but further data is needed to confirm this (Peplow, 2023).

        It seems intuitive that a more efficient solar cell is necessarily a better one. However, to deploy
      solar power on an unprecedented scale, the best solar cell is not the most efficient, but the best
      value over its entire lifespan. A traditional silicon solar cell, the kind that is bulk produced 
      and installed on commercial and residential roofs and used in the large solar farms that dot the 
      fields of many nations, typically reaches 20% efficiency, with idealized laboratory conditions
      enabling a maximum efficiency of 26.7% 2.	(Ehrler et al., 2020). Far more efficient solar cells, with efficiencies
      in real-world applications exceeding 30% and under idealized laboratory conditions exceeding 40%,
      have been developed and used, most prominently in space travel applications. However, these prove to
      be extremely expensive to produce, and use exotic and rare materials like gallium arsenide, gallium indium
      phosphide, and germanium (Li et al. 2021), making them inherently unsuitable for large scale deployment . The solution
      to this problem would be a form of solar cell that is competitively cheap to bulk produce compared to a silicon
      cell, yet delivers greater efficiency, and this is what Perovskite is hoped to deliver (Peplow, 2023).

  <p class="ex1">

        In this context, a perovskite is a material with a similar structure to the mineral called Perovskite, 
      discovered in Russia in 1839 and named after minerologist Count Lev Aleksevich von Perovski. Perovskites
      have the structure ABX3, where A and B are metallic cations, with oxidation states 2+ and 4+ respectively,
      and X is a non-metal anion, often oxygen, with oxidation state 2- (Attfield, Lightfoot, and Morris, 2015).
      
        Many perovskites have useful electrical properties, you may have heard of the superconductive
      yttrium-barium-copper-oxide, which is a perovskite material. Other perovskites exhibit conductivity,
      ferromagnetism, and in this case, the ability to form photovoltaics. (Attfield, Lightfoot, and Morris, 2015).

       Commercially available solar cells using only perovskite, up to this point, have had short lifetimes and poor
      efficiency. Those manufactured by Saule Technologies, while being physically flexible, offer a comparatively 
      measly 10% efficiency, and a lifespan of “several years” (Peplow, 2023). 
      
        A company called Microquanta has produced 5 megawatts of perovskite solar capacity, but again, these cells have
      a low efficiency of 13% and degrade at twice the rate of silicon, which loses less than 1% of its overall efficiency
      per year. Installation costs make up a very large portion of the cost to the owners of a solar array over its lifespan
      (Peplow, 2023), therefore increasing the rate at which they need to be replaced would put a very large strain on a green energy
      producer’s wallet, meaning these fragile solar cells are unlikely to see widespread use.
      
        Tandem cells, as is suggested by the name, use multiple materials in tandem to generate electricity. These materials
      are layered onto one another, and work together to absorb different wavelengths of light, increasing the solar cell’s overall
      efficiency. While a purely silicon-based cell may only have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 29%, perovskite-silicon tandem
      cells have a theoretical maximum of 45% efficiency, a nearly 50% increase (Ehrler et al., 2020). Such cells have not only been
      demonstrated as single prototypes in laboratories but manufactured using production lines. In May, Oxford PV produced an undersized 
      tandem cell with an efficiency of 28.6% using their manufacturing process, and full-size cells with an efficiency of 24%.
      These numbers continue to improve (Oxford PV, 2023).
      
        Data regarding the longevity of perovskite-silicon tandem cells, especially in real-world commercial uses, is limited.
      While there is much optimism regarding their robustness, perovskite materials undergo degradation in many ways silicon does 
      not.The crystal structure can break down, moving ions between layers and slowly reducing the cell’s ability to generate power. 
      Researchers have been able to reduce this effect by introducing nanometer thick protective layers and fine-tuning the 
      composition of the perovskite layer (Peplow, 2023). 
      
        Accelerated ageing tests, in which the cells are exposed to very harsh conditions to simulate years of use, seem to provide
      an optimistic picture of the technology, but until long-term installations are exposed to real-world conditions, it is unknown
      if the technology will be a viable alternative (Peplow, 2023).

        The greater power density offered by perovskite cells, even if it does not lead to them replacing silicon in all
      applications, is especially beneficial where space is at a premium. Rooftop solar arrays often fail to provide as
      much energy as a typical household requires, and as household demand increases through installation of heat pumps
      and purchase of battery-electric vehicles, perovskite cells might offer excellent value for domestic producers (Peplow, 2023). 
      Even if they do not prove as long-lasting as silicon cells, that may be offset by the rapid improvement of the technology,
      making replacing fairly new installations a viable option (Jean et al., 2019).
      
        The European-Union funded PEPPERONI project, which aims to “identify and address barriers to speed up technology’s mass
      manufacturing of high-performance PV modules” (PEPPERONI Project, 2023), aims to develop tandem modules with an efficiency of 26%, 
      with lifespans exceeding 30 years and can be manufactured at large scale. They have many leading industry partners, including QCELLS, 
      which is already testing tandem cells, and investing $100 million to “build a pilot tandem-cell production line” (Qcells, 2023).
      
        Overall, perovskite-silicon tandem cells are a promising technology, as they may offer a large boost to the efficiency of
      cheap, commonly available solar cells. While the current generation of tandem cells remains largely untested, and their 
      long-term performance may fall short of expectations, the field is advancing so rapidly that this may be of little 
      concern long-term.

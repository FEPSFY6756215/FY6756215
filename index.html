      Silicon based cells make up almost all solar cells in use and in production worldwide and
      have nearly reached their maximum theoretical levels of efficiency (2). This means that no
      large-scale gains can be made in the efficiency of this technology without an additional
      material being introduced, however, the introduction of additional materials may serve to
      increase cost. Therefore, the material added must be cheap, abundant, and the manufacturing
      processes used must be easily scalable, and the cells made must have no serious disadvantages
      compared to traditional cells (1). Perovskite materials can be made using cheap and abundant
      elements, but cells using only perovskite display poor longevity (1, 4). Perovskite-silicon 
      tandem cells provide greater efficiency than either single option, and may have lifespans 
      on-par with silicon cells, but further data is needed to confirm this (1, 8).

        It seems intuitive that a more efficient solar cell is necessarily a better one. However, to deploy
      solar power on an unprecedented scale, the best solar cell is not the most efficient, but the best
      value over its entire lifespan. A traditional silicon solar cell, the kind that is bulk produced 
      and installed on commercial and residential roofs and used in the large solar farms that dot the 
      fields of many nations, typically reaches 20% efficiency, with idealized laboratory conditions
      enabling a maximum efficiency of 26.7% (1, 2).

        The problem of commercially viable solar cells has always been an easier one to solve when they see an increase in energy efficiency
      without any increase in price, or use of exotic materials. While astoundingly long-lasting and efficient solar panels have been developed
      and deployed on spacecraft, as well as demonstrated in the lab, with gallium arsenide cells consistently reaching efficiencies of over 30%,
      as opposed to traditional utility-scale cells’ efficiency of around 15-20% and degrading far less quickly, these cells prove to be monstrously
      expensive to produce compared to their overall energy output, due to the rare materials and complicated manufacturing processes involved
      in producing them (CITATION 1). Effectively rolling out solar power is a balancing act between efficiency, longevity and cost, and 
      Perovskite’s ability to reduce the overall sum is promising, but still very much in question (CITATION 2).
